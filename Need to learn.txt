---------------
Named Entity Recognition - subtask of information(dates, loaction) extraction in natural language processing(unstructured text).
Key phrase extraction - identifying and extracting the most important and relevant phrases or keywords from a given text
Image classification - assigning a single label to an entire image
Object detection - detect and localize multiple objects within an image(bounding box), find the Location with image.
OCR - extracts text from images
Semantic segmentation - assigns a class label to each pixel in an image
Feature engineering - To generate additional features
Feature Selection - To eliminate irrevelent information
Scene segmentation - Determines a scene changes in video based on visual cues

Fairness: Ensuring equal treatment and avoiding bias.
Reliability and Safety: Being accurate, reliable, and safe to use, Missing , unusual values.
Privacy and Security: Respecting and protecting personal information.
Inclusiveness: Considering the needs of all individuals, impairments.
Transparency: Being open and explainable, decision making, record.
Accountability: Taking responsibility for actions, governance, standards.

Image classification metric - Confidence

Metric Evaluation:
Regression (R) - Coefficient of determination(R2), Root mean squared error(RMSE), Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Error(MSE)
Classification - Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1 score,True positive rate, AUC
Clustering - Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Dunn's Index

Formula:
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)


Metric for Custom Vision - precision, Average precision(AP), Recall 	
Describe the images - o generate automatic captions for digital photographs
Named Entity Recognition (NER) - ability to identify different entities in text and categorize them into pre-defined classes
